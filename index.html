      <h2>The Power of Awareness</h2>
      <p>In the past 6 years, Uganda has seen a significant decrease in malaria infections due to widespread public health initiatives aimed at increasing awareness.

      <h2>Steps Taken</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Educational campaigns in schools and communities.</li>
        <li>Distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets.</li>
        <li>Training health workers and volunteers to teach malaria prevention.</li>
        <li>Increased funding for research and development of vaccines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Impact</h2>
      <p>In just six years, the number of malaria cases in Uganda has dropped by 40%, a testament to the power of awareness and community-driven health initiatives.</p>
